Vision, originally called rune has been involved in numerous scandals. they're an untrustworthy group of scammers who's main goal is to have their community banned from roblox

They took payments for an unfinished product, and never delivered on such, thankfully Cassie did!

Last night Vision was Fully leaked by Cassie, exposing a whole lotta skidding, lies, scams, and furthermore bringing these bad actors to light, showing their true colors as they desperately try to push false naratives on her

We love you Cassie!


### Cassie Drama
Since the release of this information, the Vision team and some members have been attempting to DOX Cassie,
and pushing false naratives due to an image that was allegedly sent to a user

For more clarity, if you look into the External Groupchat Dump, you will release this image was sent there, and not infact anyone's dms
they have cropped it to look out of context. that along is supicious on Visions part, but eh they're known for this kind of thing.

The history behind that image, Nano and Cassie were in a vc, and she pulled it up on screenshare from some discord server, Upon doing so
Nano said "Broooooo what the fuckk... wait send it in the groupchat", This is now being used as an image to try frame cassie, But
Context has been stripped, along with them now saying the chat is full of minors (Was never clarified at any point)

So watch out with Vision, as you can see they are getting very desperate right now, it's the side affect of your exit-scam being released before you can perform it ig
(p.s, i am waiting for cassie to come back and proove they were in call)
